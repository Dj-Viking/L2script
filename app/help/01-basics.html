    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
      In programming, a variable is just a value to which you assign a name.
      It's no different than in Pre-Algebra. You can name the variable anything
      you want, but it should usually be a word that explains what it represents
      (instead of using x or y like in math class).
    </p>
    <p>
      With L2 you will define each variable by declaring its type, which L2
      currently supports three: string, number, or object.
    </p>
    <h3>Strings</h3>
    <p>
      A string is just a line of text that can be letters, numbers, and other
      symbols. It can be a word or multiple words. One way we might use a string
      variable is to set a color that we want to paint something on the screen.
      That variable can be reused multiple times, and you only have to change
      the place where the value is set.
    </p>
    <p>It's very simple:</p>
    <pre>
        string eyeColor = blue 
        string hairColor = brown 
    </pre>
    <p>Now have two string variables that we can use later in our L2 app.</p>
    <h3>Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      This is very similar to a string type, except (as you might guess) it is
      designed to contain numbers. So you might use this to store the size or
      position of certain elements, for example.
    </p>
    <pre>
        number eyeWidth = 20
        number eyeHeight = 15
    </pre>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Now this is where the power comes in! Objects in L2 are the on-screen
      display. You use objects to create shapes, display text, and other
      elements.
    </p>
    <p>There are five types of objects currently supported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>rectangle - Four-sided rectangle/square shape</li>
      <li>circle - Round shape, it can be an oval or oblonged circle</li>
      <li>line - A straight line with a given start and end point</li>
      <li>polygon - A shape of any number of points</li>
      <li>text - A box that you can write text into</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <pre>
        object background = new rectangle
        object head = new circle
        object title = new text
    </pre>
