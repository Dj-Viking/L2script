    <h1>Creating Shapes in L2</h1>
    <h2>Adding a background</h2>
    <p>
      If you've been following along, you may have noticed that creating a shape
      alone doesn't do very much. Now we have to give it some properties. So
      let's give our L2 app a background.
    </p>
    <h3>size... to</h3>
    <p>
      So, first, we create the background and assign it a size. The default
      width of an L2 canvas is a 640x640 square. So let's make our background
      object fill the entire space
    </p>
    <pre>
        object background = new rectangle
        size background to 640, 640
    </pre>
    <p>
      So here we used the <code>size</code> method, then gave it the name of the
      object we wanted to size, the keyword <code>to</code> means we want to set
      it to exactly 640 wide and 640 high.
    </p>
    <h3>paint</h3>
    <p>
      Maybe we don't want a black background (which is the default color). Let's
      paint that object a different color.
    </p>
    <pre>
        object background = new rectangle
        size background to 640, 640
        <b>paint background blue</b>
    </pre>
    <p>We should now see our background blue!</p>
    <h2>Creating a circle</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a cricle (or any other shape) is not much different than the
      rectangle we used for the background. So let's add it, size it, and paint
      it.
    </p>
    <pre>
        object sun = new circle
        size sun to 150, 150
        paint sun orange
    </pre>
    <h3>move... to</h3>
    <p>
      Cool! We've got our sun, but maybe we don't want it at the top left. Its
      default location is <code>0, 0</code>. When we position an object in L2,
      we are using x/y coordinates like that Pre-Algebra class we mentioned
      earlier. However, the origin is the top-left corner. Our x value goes to
      the right like we would expect, but our y coordinate is moving us down
      from the top. So <code>50, 70</code>, for example, would be 50 pixels from
      the left and then 70 down from the top.
    </p>
    <p>So let's position that sun.</p>
    <pre>
        object sun = new circle
        size sun to 150, 150
        paint sun orange
        <b>move sun to 50, 70</b>
    </pre>
    <p>
      We can also set negative values for our object, so that it can appear
      partially (or even fully) off screen. So let's move our sun to be only
      partly in the picture.
    </p>
    <pre>
        object sun = new circle
        size sun to 150, 150
        paint sun orange
        <b>move sun to -40, -50</b>
    </pre>
    <h2>Cut down on repetition</h2>
    <p>
      It may not have bothered you yet, but (after a while) repeating the
      variable name over and over can get quite old. We can avoid this
      repetition in one of two ways.
    </p>
    <h3>On creation of the object</h3>
    <p>
      By indenting after we create our object, we tell L2 that our command
      should take action on the previously created object. Then we can skip
      typing <code>sun</code> again.
    </p>
    <pre>
        object sun = new circle
        &nbsp; size to 150, 150
        &nbsp; paint orange
        &nbsp; move to -40, -50
    </pre>
    <h3>with</h3>
    <p>
      Alternately, we can use the <code>with</code> command to tell L2 that the
      following lines will relate to that object. We use our intent again to
      indicate this.
    </p>
    <pre>
        with sun
        &nbsp; size to 150, 150
        &nbsp; paint orange
        &nbsp; move to -40, -50
    </pre>
